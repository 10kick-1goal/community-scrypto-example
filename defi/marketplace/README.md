# Marketplace

My go at a simple marketplace where people can create buy and sell orders (no AMMs).
A user gets an order ticket for each created (buy or sell) order which they can use
to withdraw the bought tokens (and change) or the payment for sold tokens.

You can run the demo on Windows by opening PowerShell and running:

```
. .\tests\demo.ps1
```

I have yet to write a bash script for this as well.
Until then on Linux you could just follow all the resim steps in that file.
